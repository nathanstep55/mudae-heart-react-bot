# mudae-heart-react-bot

A Discord bot that automatically reacts to Mudae rolls (or any bot message with an embed containing "Claim with" in it, as of present)

This is a pretty lazy bot but it functions, and that's what matters :)

Based on [discord-bot-template](https://github.com/agubelu/discord-bot-template) by @agubelu

# Installation
Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, fill in your bot token in `settings.py` and run `python your_bot.py` to start!
